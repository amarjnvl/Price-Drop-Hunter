# SPEC.md — AI News Curator Feature

> **Status**: `FINALIZED`

## Vision
Enhance the existing Price Drop Hunter bot with an AI-powered news curation feature. Users can request news on any topic directly within Telegram and receive a fun, emoji-rich summary generated by Gemini 1.5 Flash.

## Goals
1. Integrate `feedparser` to fetch Google News RSS feeds dynamically.
2. Integrate `google-generativeai` to summarize headlines using Gemini 1.5 Flash.
3. Add a `/news <topic>` command to the Telegram bot interface.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- Storing news history in Google Sheets.
- Scheduling daily news digests (on-demand only for now).

## Users
- Existing bot users who want quick news updates without leaving Telegram.

## Constraints
- Must not break existing price tracking functionality.
- Free tier of Gemini API (polling limits apply).

## Success Criteria
- [ ] `/news` command returns a technology news summary by default.
- [ ] `/news <topic>` returns relevant news summaries for the topic.
- [ ] Bot remains responsive to price tracking commands.
